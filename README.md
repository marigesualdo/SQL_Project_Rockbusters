## This presentation was made for the company Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. 
### At a time when streaming platforms are gaining more and more space in the market,  Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

               What was the average rental duration for all videos?
               Which countries are Rockbuster customers based i n?
               Where are customers with a high l ifetime value based?
               Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

                              A powerpoint presentation with all analysis visualizations.
